          <h3>Why Avalanches?</h3>
          <p>I have been drawn to the outdoors for my entire life, and since moving to Washington state to attend
             college backcountry skiing has been my greatest passion. Backcountry skiing is an inherently risky
             activity, which requires the appropriate knowledge and respect for the dangers of snow covered mountains
             including the danger of triggering an avalanche which can lead to burial, trauma, and sometimes death.
             For a senior independent research project I am studying the interactions of climate change, decreasing mountain snowpack and backcountry recreation. One component of
             this project is an analysis of recorded avalanche fatalities, to better understand how people are putting themselves
             at risk and the dangers which exist. This avalanche mapping is conducted with the intention of the utmost respect for
             the friends and families of victims, with the goal to better learn and educate from these tragedies.</p><br>
          <h3>Explanation of Maps</h3>
          <p>The two webmaps created in this site display the locations of recorded avalanche fatalities. The first map focuses on Washington state, showing every
          recorded avalanche death in the state's history. The deadliest avalanche ever in Washington (and the United States) occured in 1910 near Steven's Pass
          when a full train and the town of Wellington was struck by a myself avalanche, killing 96 people. This was a highly unusual and tragic event. The majority of other accidents
          have occured in more recent years, typically by small groups of skiers, snowmobilers, or climbers. Clicking on individual points, a popup menu contains information
          showing the date, name of approximate location, number of deaths, and a link to a more in depth accident report. Additionally, the points are colored based on the
          activity being done at the time of the fatality.</p><br>
          <p>The second webmap displays every avalanche fatality in the United States and Canada so far in the 2020-2021 Winter season. This Winter has seen an unprecented number of deaths
            due to avalanche, likely in part due to increased backcountry usage. A better understand of how, when and where people are losing their lives due to avalanches will hopefully lead
            to increased awareness and safety from those who partake in these backcountry activities.</p><br>
          <p>The data mapped in this project was compiled by Thomas Kakatsakis from a variety of sources including the [Northwest Avalanche Center](https://nwac.us/accident-reports/), the [Colorado Avalanche Information Center](https://avalanche.state.co.us/accidents/us/), and [Avalanche Canada](https://www.avalanche.ca/incidents). In instances where an exact location is not provided, lat lon coordinates are estimated from available information. </p>
