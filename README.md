# Avalanche-Mapping
Thomas Kakatsakis

A web visualization of every recorded avalanche fatality in Washington state history, and every recorded avalanche fatality in the United States and Canada during the 2020-2021 Winter (as of March 10th)

The project has the goal of spreading awareness of the dangers of backcountry Winter recreation, and helping people to better understand the circumstances leading to tragic accidents.

Data is sourced from the Northwest Avalanche Center, The Colorado Avalanche Information Center, and Avalanche Canada. It is compiled by Thomas Kakatsakis

Github is used to manage changes and host the site. Leaflet is used to generate webmaps and display spatial data. D3 is used to visualize data. Chroma is used for color palettes and display, Font Awesome is used for map icons, JQuery is used to integrate data. Basemaps are provided by OpenStreetMap, Cartocdn, and ArcGIS.

Example code and labs created by Dr. Bo Zhao and Tyler McCrea have enabled this webmap to be possible. It is created as a final project for UW course Geography 458: Digital Geographies</p>
